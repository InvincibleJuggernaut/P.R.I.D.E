# Crack-D

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p> I would like to tout this as an alternate way to sign in to websites to safeguad against phishing attempts. Everyday, we log in to multiple websites, whether it is for e-mail, news feeds, games or social media sites. There is always a risk that the webpage that loads could have been compromised by an attacker as part of a MiTM attack or a general phishing scheme and hence the danger of your accounts being compromised without you even knowing it. </p>
